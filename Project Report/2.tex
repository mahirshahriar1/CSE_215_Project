\section*{\LARGE Purpose and benefits of Supermarket Stock Management Project}
\large The purpose behind the creation of this software was to make things easier and error free. Owner of supermarkets often face difficulties on keeping a track of the inventory. The staffs also waste a lot of time adding the total of the selling products and making an invoice. Thus, arose the need of a management software.

\section*{\LARGE Some benefits and Features of Supermarket Stock Management}
\large 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \large Easy to add/edit product.
    \item \large No chance of duplicate IDs of product. (The software will not allow it)
    \item \large Can easily check which product is not currently at stock. This allows the employee to make a list of products that needs to be restocked. 
    \item \large Sorting features available by which the user can easily check the products according to his/her needs. 
    \item \large Saves time as everything is automated. 
    \item \large While selling products to a customer, the staff just needs to select the product and write the quantity. The invoice will be automatically generated upon pressing a sell button. The invoice is also printable, and can be saved in a database for future purpose.
    \item \large Once some products are sold, no one needs to update the inventory. The inventory is automatically updated.
    \item \large Less chances of any kind of errors as the software handles most types of cases where an error might have been made. (Negative amount/more quantity sold than available/ wrong calculation of tax or summation of products)
    \item \large User Friendly Graphical Interface which is easy to use.
